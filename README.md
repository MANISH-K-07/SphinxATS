### Automated Resume Screening & Ranking System (Flask + NLP)

SphinxATS is a Flask-based web application that automates resume screening and ranking based on job descriptions using Natural Language Processing techniques. This system demonstrates how Machine Learning can assist HR professionals in filtering and ranking candidates efficiently.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

SphinxATS allows:

* HR to submit a Job Description
* Applicants to upload resumes (PDF)
* Automatic ranking of resumes based on:

  * TF-IDF Similarity
  * Skill Matching
  * Experience Matching

The system generates a ranked list of applicants along with:

* Final Score
* Similarity Score
* Skill Match Score
* Experience Score
* Matched Skills

---

## 🧠 Features

* 📄 PDF Resume Upload
* 📝 Job Description Submission
* 🔍 TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity Scoring
* 🧩 Skill-Based Matching (Predefined Technical Skills)
* 🕒 Experience Detection using Regex
* 📊 Weighted Final Score Calculation
* 📋 Ranked Resume Results Table
* 🧹 Clear Uploaded Resumes Option
* 🧑‍💼 HR Dashboard Interface
* ⚙️ Real-time Resume Ranking

---

## ⚙️ Resume Ranking Methodology

Each uploaded resume is evaluated using three major parameters:

### 1️⃣ Similarity Score

Measures how closely a resume matches the Job Description using:

* TF-IDF Vectorization
* Cosine Similarity

### 2️⃣ Skill Match Score

Matches resume content with predefined technical skills such as:

* Python
* Java
* SQL
* Machine Learning
* Data Science
* HTML / CSS / JavaScript
* Flask / Django
* C / C++
* Git
* NLP

### 3️⃣ Experience Score

Detects candidate experience using Regex patterns like:

* "2 years experience"
* "3+ years"
* "Worked for 4 yrs"

Experience score is normalized before contributing to the final score.

---

## 🧮 Final Score Calculation

Final Ranking Score is calculated as:

```
Final Score =
0.6 × Similarity Score +
0.3 × Skill Match Score +
0.1 × Experience Score
```

Resumes are ranked in descending order based on this score.
